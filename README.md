This is a proof of concept of a Web Component for the IndieWeb [WebActions](http://indiewebcamp.com/webactions) tag: `<indie-action>`

This is built using Mozilla's [X-Tags](http://x-tags.org/) library

The component can be found in `src/main.js`

A copy of X-Tags itself can be found in `demo/x-tag-components.js`, but should preferably be downloaded from X-Tags instead.
